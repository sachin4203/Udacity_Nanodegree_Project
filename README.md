Developed as a part of Udacity Nanodegree course. The code is non-functional. You will have to set the [API key first](#api-key).

## API key

To add the API key to the application, create a Java file called `DataStore.java`.

```java
package in.aviaryan.popularmovies;

public class DataStore {
    public static String API_KEY = "YOUR-API-KEY";
}
```
